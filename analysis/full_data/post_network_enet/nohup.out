In a future version, integer keys will always be treated as labels (consistent with DataFrame behavior). To access a value by position, use `ser.iloc[pos]`
  value = topology_df.iloc[i][j]  #this is coefficient calculated by ElasticNet. We will uses this to infer the weight of the edge (although this will be imputed 1 or 0)
