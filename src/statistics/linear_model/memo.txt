Cliffs delta for effect size.
Clinical covariates were included if they were found to be significant in marginal model.
For example, if the margial model of:

feature_abundance ~ age

the P-value of the coefficients of age was < 0.05, we consider age as significant confounder. Therefore age will be adjusted

feature_abundance ~ RA_phenotype + age

If multiple clinical variables were found to be significant, we adjusted them all:

feature_abundance ~ RA_phenotype + age + sex
